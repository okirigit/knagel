Installation

STEP 1
Update the application.properties file with your mongo db Atlas URL as well as the database name

Navigate to the client folder 
1.Run **npm install**
2.Run **npm run start**



This will run both the spring boot app and the vue js front end

Incase of any configuration issues just open two terminals one at the client folder(**run npm run serve**) and one on the root folder of the project run (**mvn spring-boot:run** assuming you have installed the dependecies

Let me know if there is anything i can improve on or modify.

N/B The interface is not that pretty.
